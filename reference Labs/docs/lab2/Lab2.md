# Lab 2 Master Guide (Accounts + Transactions)

Goal: help you understand local Ethereum accounts, balances, nonces, and native ETH transfers before you build larger smart-contract workflows.

## 1. Why Lab 2 Comes Now

Lab 1 introduced:
- hashing
- blocks
- chaining
- smart-contract state

Lab 2 now answers a more basic question:

**who is actually sending a blockchain transaction?**

Before we write bigger contracts, we need to understand:
- what an account is
- what a wallet is
- what a signer does
- why balance changes
- why nonce changes
- how one simple transaction becomes a new block

This is why Lab 2 stays inside the same local Hardhat stack but removes contract complexity from the center of the lesson.

---

## 2. What we Will Learn

By the end of Lab 2, you should be able to explain:
- the difference between an account, an address, a private key, a wallet, and a signer
- what a nonce is and why it increases
- how a native ETH transfer differs from a smart-contract call
- how sender and receiver balances change after a transaction
- how the API, signer, Hardhat node, and frontend work together

You should also be able to run a complete local transfer and describe exactly what changed on-chain.

---

## 3. Big Picture

Lab 2 has 4 practical parts:
1. inspect local Hardhat accounts
2. read balances and nonces from the API
3. send ETH from one local account to another
4. observe the new block, changed balances, and incremented nonce

---

## 4. One-Minute Story

Imagine four people share the same classroom blockchain network.

Each account has:
- an address
- some ETH
- a transaction counter

If account A sends `0.25 ETH` to account B:
- account A balance decreases
- account B balance increases
- account A nonce increases by 1
- the chain records a new transaction hash
- the node mines that transfer into a block

That is the smallest real blockchain workflow that still works identity, value movement, validation, and ordering.

---

## 5. Core Concept Diagram

```mermaid

    PK[Private Key] --> W[Wallet / Signer]
    W --> A[Account Address]
    A --> B[Balance]
    A --> N[Nonce]
    W --> TX[Signed Transaction]
    TX --> CH[Blockchain Node]
    CH --> BL[New Block]

    classDef identity fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32,stroke-width:2px,color:#1b5e20;
    classDef action fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#ef6c00,stroke-width:2px,color:#bf360c;
    classDef chain fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px,color:#0d47a1;

    class PK,W,A,B,N identity;
    class TX action;
    class CH,BL chain;
```

How to read it:
- the private key controls the wallet
- the wallet acts as signer
- the signer sends a signed transaction
- the chain validates and mines it
- balance and nonce are account state that you can measure

---

## 6. Lab 2 Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U["User in Browser<br/>http://localhost:8081"] --> F["Lab 2 Frontend<br/>HTML/CSS/JS"]
    F -->|HTTP| A["Lab 2 API<br/>http://localhost:3001"]
    A -->|JSON-RPC| C["Hardhat Node<br/>http://chain:8545"]
    C --> AC["Local Accounts"]
    C --> BL["Latest Block"]

    A -->|Signer uses unlocked local account| TX["ETH Transfer"]
    TX --> C
```

What this means:
- the browser never signs directly in this lab
- the API selects one local Hardhat account as signer
- the transaction goes to the Hardhat node
- the node mines it and the frontend reads the new state back

---

## 7. Transaction Lifecycle

    Chain->>Chain: Mine transaction into block
    Chain-->>API: Receipt + block number
    API->>Chain: Read balances + nonce + latest block

    Frontend-->>User: Show before/after comparison
```

## 8. What Was Added or Changed in the Repo

### New files added
- `docs/lab2/Lab2.md`
- `labs/lab2/api/package.json`
- `labs/lab2/api/src/server.js`
- `labs/lab2/frontend/index.html`
- `labs/lab2/frontend/app.js`
- `labs/lab2/frontend/styles.css`

### Existing files updated
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `README.md`
- `labs/lab2/README.md`
- `docs/lab1/Lab1.md`
- `labs/lab1/README.md`

Why these changes matter:
- Lab 2 needs its own frontend and API so it can focus on accounts and transactions instead of contract state.
- Compose was changed so normal code edits do not require rebuilding custom images every time.
- Older docs that still said `--build` were corrected so the workflow stays consistent.

---

## 9. Why Docker Compose Was Changed

You asked for a workflow where code changes are saved and then picked up by:

```bash
docker compose up -d ...
```

without rebuilding images each time.

That is now supported by design:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    R[Repository code on host] --> M[Bind mounted into container]
    M --> N[Node / nginx / python official image]
    N --> S[Service starts with current files]
    V[Named volumes for node_modules] --> N
```

Meaning:
- source code is mounted directly from the workspace
- containers run official base images
- dependency folders stay in Docker volumes
- rebuilds are only needed if you change image-level setup, not normal code

---

## 10. Lab 2 Services and Their Jobs

### `chain`
- runs `npx hardhat node`
- exposes local RPC on `8545`
- provides local funded accounts

### `lab2-api`
- runs Express + ethers
- reads account balances and nonces
- signs and sends local transfers
- reads latest block state

### `lab2-frontend`
- serves the Lab 2 working UI on `8081`
- shows account cards, latest block, transaction flow, and before/after results

---

## 11. Step-by-Step: Run Lab 2

## Step 0: Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop running
- the project opened

## Step 1: Start the Lab 2 services

```bash
docker compose up -d chain lab2-api lab2-frontend
```

Important note:
- no `--build` is needed for normal lab work

## Step 2: Check containers

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Look for:
- `bc-lab1-chain`
- `bc-lab2-api`
- `bc-lab2-frontend`

## Step 3: Open the frontend
- `http://localhost:8081`

## Step 4: Check API health
- `http://localhost:3001/api/health`

Expected:
- `ok: true`
- `chainId: 31337`
- current `blockNumber`

## Step 5: Inspect local accounts

You should observe:
- each account has ETH
- each account has a nonce
- all of this is readable from the same chain

## Step 6: Send a small transfer

Example:
- sender: Account 1
- receiver: Account 2
- amount: `0.25`

## Step 7: Observe the change

You should confirm:
- sender balance decreased
- receiver balance increased
- sender nonce increased by 1
- latest block changed
- transaction hash appeared

## 13. File-by-File Explanation

## A. `docker-compose.yml`

What changed:
- switched services from custom `build:` usage to official `image:` usage for normal runs
- kept source code mounted into containers
- added named volumes for `node_modules`
- added two new services: `lab2-api` and `lab2-frontend`

Why:
- code changes are picked up by `docker compose up -d`
- Lab 2 can run separately from Lab 1 on different ports

## B. `labs/lab2/api/package.json`

Purpose:
- defines the runtime dependencies for the Lab 2 API

Why these packages:
- `express`: HTTP server
- `cors`: allows browser requests from the frontend
- `ethers`: blockchain communication and signing

## C. `labs/lab2/api/src/server.js`

This is the core backend of Lab 2.

Important data structures:
- `localProfiles`: classroom wallets used in the lab
- `conceptCards`: short learning cards for the frontend
- `transactionStages`: the lifecycle you should memorize
- `transferRules`: simple validation and observation rules

Important functions:
- `buildProvider()`: connects to the Hardhat RPC node
- `formatEth(value)`: converts wei into readable ETH text
- `formatGwei(value)`: converts gas price into gwei
- `buildWalletCatalog(provider)`: maps the unlocked Hardhat accounts into labeled classroom signers
- `findWallet(catalog, address)`: maps a chosen address back to the right signer
- `sanitizeAccount(entry, balanceWei, nonce)`: returns safe account data for the UI
- `getAccountsSnapshot(provider)`: reads all balances and nonces
- `getLatestBlockSummary(provider)`: reads block and last-transaction info

Endpoints:
- `GET /api/health`: chain status
- `GET /api/foundation`: working content
- `GET /api/accounts`: current account state
- `GET /api/blocks/latest`: latest block summary
- `POST /api/transactions/transfer`: validate, sign, send, wait, and return before/after state

## D. (OPTIONAL) `labs/lab2/frontend/index.html`

Purpose:
- defines the learning layout you see in the browser

Main sections:
- hero and objective framing
- concept repair cards
- account cards
- latest block panel
- transfer form
- before/after results panel
- live transaction path
- event feed
- lifecycle rules and stages

## E. (OPTIONAL) `labs/lab2/frontend/app.js`

This file drives the frontend behavior.

Important functions:
- `addEvent(message, type)`: appends the runtime story to the event feed
- `setFlow(activeNodes, hint)`: highlights the current path stage
- `tracePath(path, hint)`: animates the transaction path
- `renderObjectives(items)`: prints learning objectives
- `renderCards(cards)`: prints concept repair cards
- `renderStages(stages)`: prints lifecycle stages
- `renderRules(rules)`: prints transfer rules
- `renderAccounts(accounts)`: shows account balance and nonce
- `populateAccountSelects(accounts)`: fills sender/receiver dropdowns
- `renderBlock(block)`: shows block number and latest tx
- `renderTransferResult(data)`: shows before/after state
- `loadFoundation()`: gets the static working content
- `loadHealth()`: checks whether the chain is alive
- `loadAccounts()`: refreshes balances and nonces
- `loadLatestBlock()`: refreshes the block panel
- `keepSelectionsDifferent()`: prevents sender and receiver from matching
- `refreshDashboard()`: reloads health, accounts, and latest block together
- `submitTransfer(event)`: sends the transfer and updates the UI
- `bootstrap()`: starts the page

## F. (OPTIONAL) `labs/lab2/frontend/styles.css`

Purpose:
- defines the visual language of Lab 2

What it emphasizes:
- readable dark working surface
- balance cards
- highlighted flow nodes
- animated transfer bubbles
- before/after comparison panels

## G. `README.md`, `docs/lab1/Lab1.md`, `labs/lab1/README.md`

Purpose of these edits:
- align older instructions with the no-rebuild workflow
- avoid confusing you with `--build` when code changes are already mounted

## 14. Questions to Answer After One Successful Transfer

After one successful transfer, answer the following:

1. Which balance decreased?
2. Which balance increased?
3. Which account nonce changed?
4. Did the receiver nonce change?
5. Did the latest block number stay the same or increase?
6. Is the transaction hash unique even if the amount is repeated?

These questions keep the focus on blockchain state instead of only clicking buttons.

---

## 15. Suggested Self-Guided Flow

1. Open the Lab 2 frontend.
2. Review the local accounts and note that these are funded test accounts.
3. Interpret balance and nonce before any transfer.
4. Send a small transfer.
5. Inspect the before/after panel.
6. Confirm why only sender nonce changes.
7. Compare this with Lab 1 where state changed inside a contract.

___
Lab 3 will combine both worlds: accounts plus the first real smart-contract DApp through classroom voting.

---

## 16. Common Misunderstandings to Correct

### "The receiver also sent a transaction because their balance changed"
Wrong.
Only the sender created a transaction.
That is why only sender nonce increases.

### "A transaction always means a smart contract call"
Wrong.
A simple ETH transfer is already a blockchain transaction.

### "The API owns the money"
Wrong.
The API is only acting as a controlled working bridge that uses the sender wallet to sign.

### "All balance decrease equals transfer amount only"
Not exactly.
The sender also pays gas.

---

## 17. Troubleshooting

### Frontend opens but no data

Check:

```bash
docker compose logs lab2-api
docker compose logs chain
```

### API health fails

Open:
- `http://localhost:3001/api/health`

If it fails, the Hardhat node is likely not running.

### Transfer fails immediately

Check:
- sender and receiver are different
- amount is positive
- chain is healthy

### Stop Lab 2

```bash
docker compose stop lab2-api lab2-frontend chain
```

---

## 18. Assignment for You

### Title
Local Transaction Observation Exercise

### Task
Using the Lab 2 frontend, perform and document three different local transfers.

For each transfer, record:
- sender label
- receiver label
- amount sent
- sender balance before and after
- receiver balance before and after
- sender nonce before and after
- block number
- transaction hash

### Required analysis questions

1. Why did the sender balance drop by more than the sent amount?
2. Why did the receiver nonce not change?
3. What happens if you repeat the same transfer again?
4. Why does every transaction still get a different hash?

### Small implementation extension

Modify one thing:
- add a new concept card to the frontend
- or add one more validation rule message in the API
- or add a UI warning when sender and receiver are the same

This keeps the assignment close to Lab 2 without jumping too far ahead.

## 19. Bridge to Lab 3

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    L1["Lab 1<br/>Hash + block + contract state"]
    L2["Lab 2<br/>Accounts + balances + nonce + transfer"]
    L3["Lab 3<br/>Deploy + vote in a smart contract"]
    L4["Lab 4<br/>Registry logic"]

    L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L4
```

Why this sequence is correct:
- Lab 1 explains shared state
- Lab 2 explains who sends state-changing requests
- Lab 3 combines both into deliberate contract deployment and smart-contract voting interaction

---

## 20. Final Checklist

- define account, address, wallet, signer, balance, and nonce
- run the Lab 2 frontend and API
- send a local ETH transfer
- explain why sender nonce changes
- explain why receiver balance changes without receiver nonce changing
- explain how this prepares you for smart-contract voting in Lab 3
