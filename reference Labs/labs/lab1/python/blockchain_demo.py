# This Python file is NOT a real blockchain node.
# It IS a working model that explains:
# 1. A block containing data + reference to previous block
# 2. A hash acting as a fingerprint (tiny change = totally different hash)
# 3. A chain being formed by hashes linking blocks together
# 4. Tampering becoming visible when a hash changes (breaking the chain link)
